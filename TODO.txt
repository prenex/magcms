0. Only exposure template is supported as of now because of subgal usage
1. Subgalleries are nice, but need date otherwise it breaks! Instead of dates there should be support for "ord" numbers.
2. Need support for "bullet points" for a gallery - shown below the gallery picture where subgalleries are shown.
3. Better footer with support to to "ÁSZF" (general agreement terms) and "Adatvédelmi nyilatkozat" (privacy terms) + not CC content!
4. Need a way to add a header box / scroll-stationary box with: Language choices, company email, company phone, face, linkedin, twitter, blog for the company!
5. Maybe: Way to add a floating logo over the full-image that is above the text so is not darkened
6. Maybe: Support for Multiple places for the subgal section and telling how many subgals we want to show (from-to - using indexing or ordering by date)
7. A left-right cycling variant of the full-picture section AND / OR cycling widget for descibing company member bio (image and text)
